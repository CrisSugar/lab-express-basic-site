    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p>
        Life in Norway is an information guide for English speakers living and working in Norway, and for those who want to make the move.
        The website is written entirely by foreigners from all around the world who are already settled in Norway.
        Once you're here, there's a whole new culture to explore. Our information articles and expat blogs cover everything from learning the language to the best new music, trying the food and explaining the cultural quirks we encounter.
