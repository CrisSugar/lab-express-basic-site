    <h2>Hello from the Artic!</h2>
    <p>At first glance, visiting Northern Norway at any other time except a blazing-hot summer might seem an undertaking unfit for the average traveler.Legends abound of Norway’s months of unbroken darkness, its tracts of untamed wilderness, and its history of bone-chilling winters that could make even the most committed Viking consider a career change.But don’t believe every legend you hear.Not only is Northern Norway’s less-than-luxurious side vastly overestimated, but this is one Arctic location that would be well worth seeing even if it weren’t.</p>
    <h2>How cold is winter in Arctic Norway?</h2>
    <p>Incredibly cold, right? Well the good news is, winter in Northern Norway is surprisingly mild, at least on the coast which benefits from the warming factor of the Gulf Stream.

        While temperatures from November to March can plunge well below -20C inland, they usually stay between -5 and +5C in and around Tromsø. And yes, we do get a lot of snow. A word of warning though: The wind can make it feel so much colder, so come prepared regardless!</p>
